## ðŸ’¾ Room Database Schema

The app uses a local Room database with the following entities:

- `Drink`: Predefined static list of matcha drinks (not stored in DB).
- `CartItem`: Stores drinks added to the cart with customization details.
- `OrderItem`: Tracks both ongoing and completed orders.
- `PointsHistory`: Logs reward points earned from purchases.
- `FavoriteDrink`: Saves unique drink configurations.
- `UserProfile`: Stores user information, loyalty progress, and preferences.

Each screen or activity interacts with the database through its corresponding **DAO (Data Access Object)**, ensuring clean and testable data operations.
